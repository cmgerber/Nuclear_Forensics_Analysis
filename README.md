Nuclear_Forensics_Analysis
==================================

This Repo contains a Python script and two iPython notebooks for converting output from the ORIGEN code developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory into a series of .csv files and a summary excel.

There is also a Python program which uses regression analysis to match unknown samples to known Nuclear Reactor fuels cell groupings. The program works well with the format of the summary excel file created from the ORIGEN code noted above.
